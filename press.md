“Gabriele is a magician of understated virtuosity” <br>
*Sue MacLennan – Choreographer*

**missing: general quote about Mattef**

## On Inventory / Räumung (2008-11)

“Showing an honest and thoughtful approach to her work, Reuter manages to draw in even the most diverse range of audience members. A must see artist with an original and thought-provoking approach to choreography.”<br>
*Fiona Jackson – Arts Award Magazine*

“Unpretentious & self-ironical”<br>
*Birgit Schmalmack - Hamburgtheater.de*

“Reuter is a charismatic performer with considerable charm and a real knack for communicating with an audience. She seduces us with quirkiness and a light touch without ever leaving any doubt about the conceptual rigour and the genuine interest driving her investigation into the complex relationship between dance and space”<br> *Martin Del Amo - realtimearts Australia*

My Alma Mater, Commonweal Lodge School for young ladies didn't quite know what to do about science so I haven't studied physics since I was 14 years old. Thank you Gabi Reuter for your brilliant dance based lecture on the principles of sound waves tonight @Lakeside with musician Mattef Kuhlmey.<br>
I now feel like a well educated scientist whilst enjoying world-class dance! So excited to be welcoming you to the Attenborough Arts centre next Thursday, 13th October at 7.30 - tickets going rapidly - don't miss it! An unforgettable experience full of humour, pace and sound waves!
