For The Amplitude, Reuter and Kuhlmey have found a unique language of joint authorship of performance-making between their two disciplines, defying all preconceived hierarchies between music and dance. They start simple: from the principle of the acoustic wave and its electronic amplification.

During an intensive collaborative research period of joint rehearsals in 2015, Reuter and Kuhlmey have developed a number of innovative tools of working with sound technology software and movement, such as the taming, or “tuning”, of feedback and the live sampling of micro phoned movement for building electronic music tracks.

The Amplitude uncovers new relationships between movement and sound: Movement that is heard and felt in the body and sound that can be sensed as it shapes and reshapes the room.
