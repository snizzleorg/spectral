Choreographer Gabriele Reuter and composer Mattef Kuhlmey have joined forces to create a unique collaboration that offers both a highly engaging theatrical dance performance and a fully immersive sound experience. In an intense and unusual meeting between two art forms The Amplitude uncovers new relationships between movement and sound: Movement that is heard and felt in the body and sound that can be sensed as it shapes and reshapes the room. <br>
In this collaboration both art forms can stand for themselves on stage: it is part pure dance performance, part live electronic music concert and part lecture on acoustics. But at its core, Reuter and Kuhlmey have found a unique language of joint authorship of performance-making between their two disciplines, defying all preconceived hierarchies between music and dance.
They agreed to start simple: from the principle of the acoustic wave and its electronic amplification. During an intensive collaborative research period of joint rehearsals at Dance 4 Nottingham and Tanzfabrik Berlin in 2015, Reuter and Kuhlmey have then developed a number of innovative tools of working with sound technology software and movement, such as the taming, or “tuning”, of feedback and the live sampling of micro phoned movement for building electronic music tracks. The Amplitude displays the relationship between music and dance live on stage, remixing their channels of perception by enabling movement to create sound that is able to physically move the space and the bodies of the audiences.
